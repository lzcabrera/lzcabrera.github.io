title: "d3ing a static visualization"
---

The past few days, I have had the opportunity to play around with the d3.js framework. D3 is a powerful data visualization framework. But, with great power comes a steep learning curve. Although it was really easy to follow the tutorials that cover the basics, once I had in mind a static visualization I wanted to port over to a dynamic visualization I had to revise the data set I was working (which to my fortune it was easy to do).


I had been hearing a lot about the d3 framework via twitter and ex-colleagues, so I decided to dive into it to check where was all that buzz coming from and it was a fun ride.

These are some of the tutorials I started with:

This is the static visualization I wanted to make dynamic:

Urban farming is one of my favourite hobbies and I use pinterest a lot to get ideas on how to make the most of my rooftop patio. I found this static visualization very helpful, but difficult to read, when I was doing research on what seeds to plant this spring.

Here is my dynamic version of the data represented on the poster:

There is still a lot of improvements that can be made to the d3 version to enhance the user experience. 

I'll keep you posted next time I get some spare time to work on this side project.
