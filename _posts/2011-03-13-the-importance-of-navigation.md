title: "The Importance of Navigation"
---
Came across and interesting article about the <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/?p=4728#more-4728">importance of navigation</a> on websites. Bill Slawski, from <a href="http://www.seobythesea.com/">SEO by the Sea</a>, explains the issue with some very useful analogies that you can use to determine if your website's navigation is actually helping people find their way around the site.
