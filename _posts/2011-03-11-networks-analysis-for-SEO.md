title: "Network Analysis for SEO"
---
I had the opportunity to attend Charlotte Bourne's presentation on <a href="http://theresultspeople.com/2011/03/09/network-analysis-seo/">Network Analysis for SEO</a> a couple of weeks ago and I wanted to share her presentation as it is a very interesting topic.<br />
<br />
My favourite part of the presentation was when she talked about some network analysis tools that let you piece together (through graphs) the reason why it is important to have a social media strategy that will interact nicely with your SEO strategy that will eventually help achieve your business objectives by increasing your company's social network.
