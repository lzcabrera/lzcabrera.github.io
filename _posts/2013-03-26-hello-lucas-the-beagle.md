title: "Hello Lucas The Beagle"
---

<p>I got a beagle puppy as a birthday present. His name is Lucas and he is a tri-colour beagle with freckles on his face. He will be coming home in a couple of weeks. You can check out his blog at <a href="http://lucasthebeagle.tumblr.com">http://lucasthebeagle.tumblr.com</a>.</p>

<p>I know I'll be taking lots of pictures and videos so I figured I should create a blog to upload stuff to share with family/friends interested to meet the new addition to the family.</p>

<p>I love <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblr's</a> iPhone app interface. It is really easy to use and it feels modern and elegant and it sticks to what it is a robust blogging platform and community where you can create your own templates. Although, sometimes I really wish I had a little bit more flexibility on updating certain sections of a template.</p>

<p>I started the blog without thinking that I would modify one of the free templates, but after a bit of research and tinkering around I have managed to setup disqus commenting platform, embedded a twitter widget and edited the template by improving the mark-up to enhance SEO performance of future posts.</p>

<p>Follow <a href="http://lucasthebeagle.tumblr.com">@lucas_thebeagle</a> if you want to stay up-to-date with the latest Lucas' adventures.</p>
