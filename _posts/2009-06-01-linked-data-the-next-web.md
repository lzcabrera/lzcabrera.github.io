title: "Linked Data: The Next Web"
---
Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web 20 years ago and he is still working on his invention. He is now building a web for open, linked data and would like us all to unlock our data and reframe the way we use it together. If you are already part of a social network and share information with others you are already doing your share as an individual.<br />
<br />
He is also encouraging institutions and governments to provide raw data so it can be used by everyone for many different purposes, not just to create pretty websites.<br />
